Apache tomcat is an open source web server. here we will deploy all the war files generated in java application.... Default port num is 8080
first we have to download apache tomcat into our system.

wget https://downloads.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.111/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.111.tar.gz

this will download in tar form so we have to install it by untaring for this we will use-
tar -xvf downloaded apache tomcat

ow tomcat is installed in our machine.

there are few important files in tomcat 
---
in bin folder we have 2 files startup.sh and shutdown.sh by running these shell scripts we will start and stop the apache tomcat server.
sh startup.sh -----to start the server
sh shutdown.sh ---- to shutdown the server
----

in conf folder we have few files to edit so that we can change the default port number and we can give username and password to the tomcat

1. vi server.xml ----> here we can change the default port num 
if we change the port num themn we have to add it in ec2 instance security groups
2. vi tomcat-users.xml ---> we can add username and password after this we have to comment few lines in context.xml files
3. come to root and find - / -name context.xml
4. edit all the list of files and comment the valve 
after that only u can be able to login by using above username and password.
